# Veyro

Multi-tenant gym management platform. Python 3.13, FastAPI, PostgreSQL 16, no ORM.
Claude Code is the development environment; GitHub Actions runs CI and nothing else.

Authority: `knowledge/00-Decisions/OWNER-2026-11-13-full-engineering-delegation.md`. Ordinary
engineering, product, architecture, infrastructure and repository decisions are delegated to the
session. Make them; do not ask. Module implementation is not gated on another module's acceptance.

## Layout

```
backend/app/            service code
  main.py               HTTP surface (platform plane + tenant plane)
  db.py                 per-plane connection pools and the tenant context manager
  config.py             environment configuration, fails closed
  tenancy/service.py    tenant lifecycle and the organization hierarchy
  tenancy/domain/       pure decision functions derived from the TSD; no I/O
  tenancy_s0.py         ProvisionTenant envelope validation (reused by the service)
  configuration/        MOD-005: evaluation.py decides, service.py does the I/O
  billing/              MOD-015: money.py, subscription.py, usage.py decide; service.py writes
  errors.py             the four service errors every module's service raises
backend/migrations/     platform/ and tenant/ SQL, applied in filename order
backend/tests/          unittest suites; tests/sql/isolation.sql is the isolation proof
backend/scripts/        verify_db.sh rebuilds the database and runs the isolation suite
knowledge/              decisions and module notes
tools/                  governance and lint tooling (see "Tooling that still earns its place")
```

Sources of product scope and architecture: the two `.docx` baselines and
`veyro-product-experience-design/`, pinned by SHA-256 in `PROJECT_INDEX.md`. The owner edited the
EIP and TSD on 2026-11-13; those edits are **uncommitted working-tree changes** and the pins still
bind the committed bytes. Adopting them means re-pinning `PROJECT_INDEX.md` and
`governance/registry.json` together, which is authorized but not yet done — see §5 of the
delegation record.

## Running it

Start the development database and build the schema:

```bash
docker run -d --name veyro-pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=veyro_dev -e POSTGRES_DB=veyro -p 127.0.0.1:55432:5432 postgres:16-alpine
```

```bash
backend/scripts/verify_db.sh
```

`verify_db.sh` drops and rebuilds the database, applies every migration, and runs the
tenant-isolation suite. It is the fastest way to know the control plane is intact. To prove a
check still bites, break the thing it guards and watch it fail:

```bash
MUTATE="ALTER TABLE plt01.organizations NO FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;" backend/scripts/verify_db.sh
```

The backend checks, each a separate command so one failure does not hide the rest:

```bash
(cd backend && python3 -m ruff check .)
```

```bash
(cd backend && python3 -m mypy)
```

```bash
(cd backend && VEYRO_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:veyro_dev@127.0.0.1:55432/veyro python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t . -v)
```

```bash
(cd backend && python3 -m unittest discover -s app/tenancy/domain/tests -t . -v)
```

These need `backend/requirements-dev.lock` installed in the active interpreter. The repository
carries a `.venv/` (gitignored) created for this purpose; if `ruff`, `mypy`, `fastapi` or
`psycopg` is missing, install the lock into it rather than working around the gap. Say so if the
install is refused — CI covers these, but a local red is cheaper than a red `main`.

Dependencies are declared in `backend/requirements.txt` and hash-pinned in
`backend/requirements.lock`; regenerate with
`uv pip compile backend/requirements.txt --universal --python-version 3.13 --generate-hashes -o backend/requirements.lock`.

## What must not be weakened

These are product requirements, not process, and they hold whatever the schedule says.

**Tenant isolation.** Every table in `plt01` carries `tenant_id uuid NOT NULL`, a tenant-leading
primary key, `ENABLE` *and* `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, a policy whose predicate is
`tenant_id = NULLIF(current_setting('app.tenant_id', true), '')::uuid`, and composite foreign keys
that carry `tenant_id` into every parent reference. Copy the pattern in
`backend/migrations/tenant/0001_organization_hierarchy.sql` exactly; each of the four parts is
load-bearing and the comment there says why.

Context is set with `set_config('app.tenant_id', %s, true)` inside a transaction — never at
session level, never interpolated into SQL. With no context the predicate is NULL, so reads return
nothing and writes are refused: **isolation fails closed, and that is the property to protect.**
`app.tenancy.db.tenant_scope` is the only way to reach `plt01`; do not add another.

**The two planes are separate.** `veyro_cp_app` holds privileges in `plt01` and nothing on the
tenant registry; `veyro_cp_platform` holds the registry and nothing in `plt01`. Neither is a member
of the other — never write `GRANT <role> TO <role>`. Neither runtime role may hold `TRUNCATE` or
`REFERENCES`, and `veyro_cp_app` may not hold `DELETE`.

**Negative tests must actually fail closed.** A test that still passes when you remove the
protection is not evidence. Every isolation check in `backend/tests/sql/isolation.sql` has been run
against a deliberate mutation and shown to fail; a new one earns its place the same way. This
caught a weak check already: an earlier "the app role cannot DELETE" test passed only because a
foreign key refused the delete first.

**Also binding:** authentication and AAL-3 (MOD-007, not yet wired in), immutable audit,
financial correctness, residency and retention. Validate input at trust boundaries. Historical
review outcomes and the preserved evidence trees outside the repository are never rewritten.

**Owner-reserved**, on the owner's standing instruction and never inferred: real financial
expenditure, production deployment, real member data, and anything needing the owner's personal
authentication. `governance/registry.json` `reserved_actions` keeps the four names.

## State

Module ids come from `tools/mission_runner/module_catalog.json`, and they are **not** the
TSD's section order. PLT-01 is MOD-004, PLT-02 is MOD-005, but PLT-03 is MOD-015 — MOD-006 is
the Compose Multiplatform qualification. Check the catalogue before naming a module; this
session has already labelled one wrong by assuming the two orders matched.

**MOD-004 (tenancy control plane) — implemented, not accepted.** Working: the `plt01_platform`
registry with tenant lifecycle and append-only history, idempotent provisioning, the `plt01`
organization/legal-entity/brand/location hierarchy under forced RLS, and an HTTP surface over
both planes. Proven: isolation checks 1-13, each mutation-tested.

Known gaps, deliberate and worth reading before extending:

- **No authentication.** `X-Veyro-Tenant` is a claim, shape-checked and nothing more. Isolation
  does not depend on it being honest, but authorization does not exist yet. MOD-007 owns
  identity and authentication; MOD-008 owns roles, permissions, approvals and audit.
- **No reactivation.** `domain/lifecycle.py` admits only `provisioned → active → suspended →
  archived`. TSD §10.3 puts reactivation in PLT-03; do not invent the edge here.
- **No hard deletion.** `delete_tenant` refuses by design: PLT-01-R07 bars it until the legal,
  billing and retention gates exist. That refusal *is* the implemented requirement.
- **`/healthz` is liveness only** and returns ok while the database is unreachable. A readiness
  endpoint that checks the pool is unwritten.
- Departments and cost centres (PLT-01-R02) are unbuilt; nothing reads them yet.
- Most modules under `app/tenancy/domain/` are not wired into the service. `lifecycle` is. The
  rest are spec analyses, and several say in their own docstrings that their answers are the
  author's reading rather than a sourced fact — read that before depending on one.

**MOD-005 (PLT-02 configuration, feature flags and experimentation) — implemented.** Seven
`cfg_*` tables in `plt01` under the same forced RLS, a typed configuration registry with
validation and tenant/brand/location inheritance, append-only value versions with rollback and
preview, feature flags with arbitrary targeting attributes and basis-point rollout, kill switches
that outrank every rule, deterministic experiment assignment with recorded exposures, and a
single-read bundle for mobile, kiosks and devices. Proven: isolation checks 14-20, each
mutation-tested; 32 evaluation unit tests that need no database; 34 integration tests.

Two tables are insert-only in the privilege layer — `cfg_values` and `cfg_exposures` — so a
published value cannot be rewritten and a recorded exposure cannot be revised. That is the
mechanism behind "every change is reversible" and "repair without history rewrite", and checks 19
and 20 prove the grants rather than trusting the migration's comment.

Known gaps, deliberate:

- **No experiment metrics, guardrails or decision records** (part of PLT-02-R04). They need a
  metrics pipeline that does not exist; a decision record with no measurements behind it would be
  worse than the gap.
- **No approval workflow** (part of PLT-02-R05). Approval needs an authenticated principal and
  MOD-007 is not wired in, so there is nobody to approve as. TSD paragraph 1020's change control
  for financial and security flag changes in production is therefore not satisfied by anything
  here; this service runs in local, development and staging only.
- **No outbox and no published events.** `configuration.changed`, `feature_flag.evaluated`,
  `experiment.exposed` and `experiment.completed` are named in the TSD and nothing consumes them
  yet. An outbox nothing drains is a table that grows.
- Targeting attributes are flat strings compared for equality. The seven dimensions PLT-02-R02
  names are all expressible that way; set membership and ranges are not, and would need a richer
  match format.

**MOD-015 (PLT-03 plans, subscriptions, metering and invoices) — implemented.** The plan
catalogue lives in `plt01_platform` with no runtime-role grant; nine `bil_*` tables live in
`plt01` under forced RLS. Working: plan versions with prices and entitlement limits, subscriptions
that snapshot the plan they were sold on, the trial/dunning/grace/suspension/reactivation
lifecycle, plan changes with day-count proration, entitlement grants and checks, idempotent
metering with late events and corrections, quotas with overage or hard stop, and issued invoices
with lines, tax, partner revenue share and credit notes. Proven: isolation checks 21-26, each
mutation-tested (13 mutations, every one caught by its own check); 74 domain unit tests that need
no database; 50 integration tests.

Three decisions in this module are worth knowing before extending it:

- **Every amount is an integer in minor units.** No column and no function is floating point.
  Rounding is half away from zero, so a credit and the charge it reverses have the same
  magnitude, and `money.allocate` splits by largest remainder so a divided total still sums to
  itself. The conventions are stated at the top of `app/billing/money.py` because the sources
  state none; proration is actual days over actual days in the period.
- **A published plan version is immutable, by privilege.** `saas_prices` and
  `saas_plan_entitlements` carry no UPDATE grant at all and `saas_plans` carries a column-level
  UPDATE on its three lifecycle columns only. Re-pricing means a new version; subscriptions
  already sold keep their snapshot, so an old invoice stays reconstructible.
- **An invoice has no draft state.** The five ledger tables are insert-only for both runtime
  roles, so a row exists only once issued and a correction is a credit note rather than an edit.

Known gaps, deliberate:

- **No payment provider and no stored payment methods.** Taking a card is real money and the
  owner reserves that. `payment_failed` and `payment_recovered` are the commands an integration
  would call, and they work today against synthetic input.
- **No tax engine.** `issue_invoice` takes a rate; rates are jurisdictional and the sources state
  none. A credit-balance invoice carries no tax rather than a negative one.
- **No cost or gross-margin view** (PLT-03-R07). It needs cloud, AI, messaging and support cost
  feeds that do not exist here.
- **No outbox and no published events**, as in MOD-005.
- `change_plan` takes the tenant's current usage from the caller. The modules that own those
  counts are not this one, so it does not guess at them, and it never deletes anything to make a
  smaller plan fit — it refuses, lists the breaches, and proceeds only when acknowledged.

**Next.** The control plane now has tenancy, configuration and commerce, and the gap every one
of those three modules ran into is the same: there is no authenticated principal. MOD-005 could
not build approval, MOD-015 could not build change control for financial flag changes, and
`X-Veyro-Tenant` is still a claim nobody checks. **MOD-007 (identity, authentication, passkeys and
device sessions) is therefore the next thing worth building**, with MOD-008 (authorization, roles,
approvals, audit) behind it.

The catalogue lists MOD-006 (Compose Multiplatform qualification) as a dependency of MOD-007. That
dependency is a client-side proof — whether the mobile stack is production-worthy — and the
server-side identity plane does not need it to exist. Build the server side first and record
MOD-006 as unbuilt rather than pretending the order was met.

Finish a module's real requirements and tests, then move on.

## Tooling that still earns its place

- `tools/migration_lint/migration_lint.py lint --track tenant|platform --tests-root backend/tests/sql <files>`
  — static checks on migration SQL. **Run it on every new migration.** It is strict and useful: it
  refused the hierarchy migration until `legal_entities` had a real negative test. It reads SQL
  only and asserts nothing about a live cluster; `verify_db.sh` is the live half.
- `python3 tools/governance/governance_check.py check --root .` — structural check; mainly catches
  drift between `PROJECT_INDEX.md` and `governance/registry.json`. CI runs it. It is not a gate on
  your work, but keep it green.
- `node tools/screen_contracts/screen_contracts.mjs check-identity` — screen registry identity.
  `check-complete` fails by design (1530 per-screen fields deferred to the owning product modules).
- `tools/mission_runner/` is retired as an execution path — its launchd services are stopped and
  it must not be restarted or rebuilt — but it is tracked code whose tests CI runs. Leave it.

## Workflow

Smallest reviewable change. Match the surrounding code's naming and comment density. Run the
checks above, then commit and push to `main` — no force, no history rewrite. Confirm CI is green
on the pushed commit:

```bash
gh run list --commit "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" --json headSha,databaseId,conclusion,event
```

Look for `event` `push`, a matching `headSha` and `conclusion` `success`. A green run on another
SHA proves nothing. If it fails, repair forward or revert; never force-push, and do not stack work
on a red `main`.

Use an independent review for genuinely risky work — tenant isolation, authentication, money,
anything whose failure is silent. Not for prose. Do not open a review loop on documentation.
