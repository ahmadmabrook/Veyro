# Cross-Module Bug Registry

Appendix D field: "Cross-module defect ledger with retest/regression state."

Per-module detail files remain the durable source (`knowledge/03-Modules/<MOD>/evidence/bugs/BUG-*.md`) — this is the cross-module index required by Appendix D, generated from those files.

| Bug | Module | Severity | Status | Retest/regression evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BUG-001 | MOD-000 | Major | FIXED | Manifest re-verified byte-identical (chunk 1 + Phase 5 gatekeeper independent rebuild) |
| BUG-002 | MOD-000 | Blocker | CLOSED | Git recovery proof, clone-and-verify passed |
| BUG-003 | MOD-000 | Major | CLOSED | Deletion manifest + absence verification |
| BUG-004 | MOD-000 | Minor | FIXED | Wording corrected, no rerun needed |
| BUG-005 | MOD-000 | Major | FIXED | Re-tested for real in the Phase 5 manual-QA re-run (Accessibility confirmed still correctly BLOCKED) |
| BUG-006 | MOD-000 | Major | OPEN | Needs an architecture decision (which Opus role performs qualification) — being remediated this chunk |
| BUG-007 | MOD-000 | Major | OPEN | 33 scenario detail blocks — being authored this chunk |
| BUG-008 | MOD-000 | Blocker | FIXED | Real fresh-context Opus manual-QA re-run, all 4 remediated findings verified |
| BUG-017 | MOD-000 | Major | IN PROGRESS | This vault migration itself is the remediation |

**0 open Blocker-severity bugs. 2 open Major-severity bugs (BUG-006, BUG-007), both being actively remediated this chunk, not silently carried.**
