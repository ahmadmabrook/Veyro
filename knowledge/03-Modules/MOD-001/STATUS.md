# MOD-001 — Module Status

Appendix D field: "Module lifecycle state, dependencies, gate checklist and
approval status. For every prerequisite edge record dependency state,
SOFTWARE_ONLY boolean/justification, gated-capability non-use evidence and
proof reference."

**Lifecycle state: ACTIVATED — PLANNING/SPECIFICATION IN PROGRESS.** Not
Ready, not Approved, implementation not started. Activated this session
per the EIP §8 unlock rule, after independently re-verifying (not merely
trusting the activation prompt) that MOD-000 holds a genuine Module
Approval Certificate (`knowledge/03-Modules/MOD-000/APPROVAL.md`,
`MOD-000 CERTIFICATION APPROVED`, P0=0/P1=0), that all 4 governing
baseline hashes still match `PROJECT_INDEX.md` (`verify_baselines.py`
re-run this session, PASS), and that `knowledge/05-QA/BUG_REGISTRY.md`
carries 0 open Blocker/P1 bugs (1 open P2, BUG-010, non-blocking,
owner-decision-pending).

**Module:** Repository, CI/CD, Environments & Quality Engineering.
**Wave:** Foundation.
**TSD scope:** GOV-01.
**Prerequisite:** MOD-000 (APPROVED).

**Dependencies:** MOD-000 only, satisfied. SOFTWARE_ONLY: true (MOD-001
is infrastructure/quality-engineering foundation work — repo skeleton,
CI/CD, environments, test harnesses/contracts — not a product/domain
module; no membership/billing/booking/POS/member-coach-experience/
access-control-product-logic/CRM implementation belongs here even where
this module must build the harnesses those later domains will plug
into).

**Gated-capability non-use evidence:** MOD-001 planning this session
has touched zero paid services, zero real member data, zero Production
activation. `OWNER_APPROVALS.md`'s owner-reserved restrictions remain in
force unchanged.

**`BUG-028` — CLOSED (2026-09-14).** Owner extracted the EIP/TSD to
durable markdown mirrors outside this guarded session
(`knowledge/00-System/EIP_MIRROR.md`, `TSD_MIRROR.md`); this session
independently verified them (baselines still PASS 4/4, mirror identity
text matches, real MOD-001 content reads correctly) before relying on
them. See `knowledge/03-Modules/MOD-001/evidence/bugs/BUG-028-docx-read-capability-gap.md`.

**Gate checklist:**

- [x] Fresh-session bootstrap + prerequisite verification (MOD-000
      certificate, baseline hashes, bug registry, owner approvals, WIP=1,
      MOD-002 lock) — all independently re-verified from durable state.
- [x] MOD-001 activated in durable control plane (`CURRENT_STATE.md`,
      `PROJECT_INDEX.md`, `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`, this file).
- [x] Capability gap found, filed, routed to owner, resolved, and
      closed (`BUG-028`).
- [x] GOV-01-R01..R08 requirement materialization with full docx-sourced
      traceability — `REQUIREMENTS.md` §1, every requirement cites exact
      `EIP_MIRROR.md`/`TSD_MIRROR.md` line ranges, no TBD placeholders.
- [x] Additional MOD-001-owned EIP/TSD control obligations traced —
      `REQUIREMENTS.md` §3 (six architecture gates, capability-governance
      validation, baseline-binding validation, Appendix-B/Appendix-I
      traceability validators, idempotency-contract lint, AsyncAPI event
      registry, scenario-matrix validator, external-gate consistency
      validator, Appendix I invariants DOM-001/DOM-002/EVT-001/IAM-002/
      INV-GOV-01/RB-GOV-01).
- [x] Capability-gap analysis (full, all MOD-001 workstreams) —
      `CAPABILITIES.md`. No blocker found; tool/vendor selection
      correctly deferred to implementation time per DC-18/DC-19.
- [x] Repository/environment/CI-CD plan, architecture-gate
      negative-fixture plan — `IMPLEMENTATION.md` §1-9, grounded in TSD's
      own reference-stack table (not invented) and TSD §24.1's real
      pipeline-stage ordering.
- [x] Module specification (full) — this file + `REQUIREMENTS.md` +
      `IMPLEMENTATION.md` + `CAPABILITIES.md` + `LOAD_SECURITY.md` +
      `MODEL_ROUTE.md` + `TEST_PLAN.md` together constitute it, per this
      project's existing MOD-000 file-set convention.
- [x] Scenario Catalog — `SCENARIOS.md` (see that file's §0/§1/§2 for
      the current scenario count, category coverage, and named-family
      count — deliberately not restated here after three consecutive
      rounds found a number duplicated across files going stale). Full
      Appendix G category coverage confirmed at each round; none marked
      PASS (implementation hasn't started).
- [x] **`BUG-029` (capability gap: `.claude/agents/**` Edit/Write-denied,
      blocked agent-file creation) — CLOSED.** Owner created all 3 files
      outside this guarded session (commit `f3a1710`); byte-verified.
- [x] **`BUG-030` (capability gap: `.claude/agents/**` Edit/Write-denied
      for *existing* files; `veyro-implementer.md`'s escalation list
      didn't name the new critical-slice role) — CLOSED.** Owner patched
      both files (commit `9f5efd4`); byte-verified. A corrected 3-case
      routing drill, dispatched to `veyro-implementer` (the correct
      subject), proved real escalation to `veyro-critical-engineer` on
      an in-scope task, correct retention on a routine task, and correct
      escalation to `veyro-lead` on an architecture/scope task. See
      `evidence/model-routing/ROUTING_DRILL_2026-09-14.md`.
- [x] Independent re-review of `veyro-critical-engineer`'s routing
      (fresh-context `veyro-security-reviewer`, Opus) — **VEYRO-CRITICAL-ENGINEER
      REGISTRATION APPROVED**, with P1/P2 findings requiring
      remediation before Definition of Ready (documentation
      propagation gaps this session's own remediation addresses below;
      ADR-005 condition 4's model-identity gap remains a disclosed,
      `BUG-027`-class residual, not closable this session).
- [x] Independent fresh-context `veyro-scenario-reviewer` pass —
      **round 1: BLOCKED (P0=4, P1=9). Round 2: BLOCKED (P0=3, P1=10).
      Round 3: BLOCKED** (see `SCENARIOS.md` §5 for the current round's
      exact P0/P1/P2/Editorial counts and findings — not restated here,
      per the lesson every round of this remediation has now taught
      about facts restated in more than one place going stale). All
      three rounds' findings remediated in the same session they were
      found, to the extent fixable without further owner action.
- [ ] Definition of Ready — **not yet reached.** See `SCENARIOS.md` §5's
      current round for what remains.

**Approval status: NOT READY. NOT APPROVED.** No Module Approval
Certificate exists or is expected at this stage — this is a planning
turn. MOD-001 implementation has not started and will not start until
Definition of Ready is met and independently confirmed, per this
project's WIP=1 / no-self-certification discipline.
